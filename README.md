# Image-Style-Transfer-and-Image-Classification-Using-Part-of-the-VGG19-Model-Architecture

This is my individual programming assignment 2 of COMP4211 Machine Learning in HKUST.

This programming assignment involves image style transfer, image augmentation and image classification.

The link to the Google Drive that contains all the necessary training dataset, testing dataset, image for performing style transfer, image for image classification, the pre-trained weights of VGG19 model, model weights, Jupyter Notebook, augmented images: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zbo39woH0l3I429h6jiAVNIzErgrhfy8?usp=drive_link

(Original shared Google Drive that contains all the training dataset, testing dataset, image for performing style transfer, image for image classification and the pre-trained weights of VGG19 model: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_5LoxbmWDKPKi91Z_HmQn4TFoTtXnxQM?usp=sharing )

You should see the following things in this repository:

* pa2.pdf: the instruction for this programming assignment
* report.pdf: the report for this programming assignment
* code.ipynb: the Jupyter Notebook
* code.zip: a zip file contains the Jupyter Notebook

You should see the following things in the shared Google Drive link:

* COMP4211 Dataset: a folder than contains the training dataset, testing dataset, image for image for performing style transfer, image for image classification, the pre-trained weights for VGG19 model
* COMP4211 PA2 model weights and Jupyter Notebook: a folder that contains the model weights for 3 models I have built in this programming assignment and the source code
* COMP4211_PA2_CLASSIFICATION: a folder that contains all the augmented images and a tsv file that list all the filenames of the augmented images

## How to run?

1. Download and put all the files to the same folder in Google Colaboratory
2. Adjust the file paths inside the Jupyter Notebook if necessary
3. Run all the codes
